<h1>Basic Print Layout Properties</h1>

<p>In this chapter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the box model</li>
	<li>margins</li>
	<li>padding</li>
	<li>Units: in or pt vs. px</li>
	<li>box sizes (later, @page)</li>
	<li>positioning</li>
	<li>floats
	<ul>
		<li>http://alistapart.com/article/goingtoprint/</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>pagebreaks</li>
	<li>images</li>
	<li>backgrounds (move to print vs. web?)
	<ul>
		<li>Remove colors and images. You can do this all at once with the shorthand background property.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>colors (move to print vs. web?)
	<ul>
		<li>Many people don't have colored printers. Also, colored ink is expensive. Respect your users' wallets.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all properties you use for web layout, but they can have different uses when it comes to print.</p>

<h5>Respect Your Users' Ink</h5>

<p>When you start a design project, you need to know the constraints: who's the audience, what media will the project appear in, what's the budget? When you're building a print stylesheet for a web page, you don't really know what those constraints are. Sure, you could target the stylesheet at high-end multi-color inkjet printers that can handle a variety of paper sizes, but most of your home audience is probably working with something a lot simpler, like a black-and-white 8.5 x 11 printer, and they're probably <em>not</em> printing your web page to frame and hang on the wall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's another way of thinking about responsive design: responsive for the home-printer. This doesn't mean that you need to eliminate all color from the print CSS, but make sure that whatever color you use is going to look ok in gray as well. And most importantly, don't waste your users' ink. For example, white text on an all-black page is probably not the best choice.</p>
