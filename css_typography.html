<h1>CSS Typography</h1>

<p>In this chapter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>fonts
	<ul>
		<li>Font usage depends entirely on the users system. They can't print using a font they don't personally have, so webfonts aren't an option.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Font units: pt vs. px
	<ul>
		<li>Points were designed for print. Using px for print makes as little sense as using pt for web.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>indents</li>
	<li>line spacing</li>
	<li>paragraph spacing</li>
	<li>headings</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these principles apply to both web design and print design.</p>

<p>Sometime books indent all their paragraphs. Use text-indent for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also outdent (eg, a bibliography) using margin-left and a negative text-indent.</p>
