<h1>Counters</h1>

<p>CSS counters power one of the most essential aspects of paged media: the page number (or, in professional printing terminology, the <em>folio</em>). However, counters can be used for more than just a page number.</p>

<h1>Strings</h1>

<p>Strings are not new to CSS, but they have a lot of power within the context of printed media. A string is like a saved variable that can be used in different places throughout a document. For example, you could save your headings as a string, and then print those titles as a running header across every page of your document. As the headings change, so too does the running header.&nbsp;</p>
