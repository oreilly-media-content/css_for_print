<h1>Counters</h1>

<div data-type="note">
<h1>counter-increment</h1>

<p>Defines the counter and determines where and by how much to increment it.</p>

<p>Syntax:&nbsp;</p>

<p>h1 {</p>

<p>&nbsp; counter-increment: sectionnumber 2;</p>

<p>}</p>
</div>

<p>CSS counters power one of the most essential aspects of paged media: the page number (or, in professional printing terminology, the <em>folio</em>). However, counters can be used for more than just a page number.</p>

<p>Before you can start using a counter, you need to initiate it using the counter-reset property. This property actually serves two purposes: it sets the counter to a starting position, and it resets the counter as needed. For example, if you want to number the figures within each chapter of a book, you could add a counter to each figure, resetting the counter to start at one with each new chapter.</p>

<h1>Strings</h1>

<p>Strings are not new to CSS, but they have a lot of power within the context of printed media. A string is like a saved variable that can be used in different places throughout a document. For example, you could save your headings as a string, and then print those titles as a running header across every page of your document. As the headings change, so too does the running header.&nbsp;</p>
