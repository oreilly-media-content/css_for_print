<p>The process of writing is one of constant flux. Counters and generated content are powerful tools to both save you headaches as content evolves, and to allow you to insert dynamic text that adapts to the different pieces of your document. Generated content can be used in many places: running headers and footers on a page, footnotes, cross references, a table of contents--any place where you want to reference content that might change.</p>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Counters</h1>

<div class="cssproperty" data-type="note">
<h1>counter-reset</h1>

<p>Initiates the counter and subsequently resets the counter to a specified value (one, by default). Can accept multiple values.</p>

<p>Syntax:&nbsp;</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
body {
&nbsp; counter-reset: page chapternumber 10 sectionnumber;
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="cssproperty" data-type="note">
<h1>counter-increment</h1>

<p>Defines the counter and determines where and by how much to increment it.</p>

<p>Syntax:&nbsp;</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
h1 {
&nbsp; counter-increment: sectionnumber 2;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>CSS counters power one of the most essential aspects of paged media: the page number (or, in professional printing terminology, the <em>folio</em>). However, counters can be used for more than just a page number--you can set up counters for any element you like, to create things like chapter and section numbers that you can add automatically to your chapter openers or running headers, or other places in your document.</p>

<p>Before you can start using a counter, you need to initiate it using the <code>counter-reset</code> property. This property actually serves two purposes: it sets the counter to a starting position, and it resets the counter as needed. For example, if you want to number the figures within each chapter of a book, you could add a counter to each figure, resetting the counter to start at one with each new chapter. You can reset multiple counters within one <code>counter-reset</code> declaration, and you can also start the counter off at a specific number. For example, you can start your chapters off at 10, and then increment every chapter by 10 thereafter, using the <code>counter-increment</code> property.</p>

<div data-type="warning">
<p><code>counter-reset</code> is subject to the cascade. This means that if you define two <code>counter-reset</code> properties within one element, only the second will take effect (as with all things cascade, the second declaration overrides the first, as if it had never existed at all):</p>

<pre data-code-language="css" data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
body {
&nbsp; counter-reset: chapternumber 10;
&nbsp; counter-reset: sectionnumber;
}
</pre>

<p>Instead, reset both counters (or as many as you like) within the same <code>counter-reset</code> instance:</p>

<pre data-code-language="css" data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
body {
&nbsp; counter-reset: chapternumber 10 senctionnumber;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p><code>counter-increment</code> accepts two values: the id of the counter to increment, and a number by which to increment it. The id can be anything at all, and doesn't need to be defined anywhere else in the document (though it can be used multiple times, and will also need to be initiated in the <code>counter-reset</code> property at least once). You can also choose how you want the counter to increment; by default, the counter will increase in value by one at each occurrence, but you could increase by any number, or even count down by using a negative number. Choose what number to start the count off when you initiate the counter with the <code>counter-reset</code> property.</p>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2><code>page</code> and <code>pages</code></h2>

<p>The CSS3 paged media module added two built-in counters: <code>page</code> and <code>pages</code>. The page counter increments by 1 with each new page of your document, unless you specify otherwise using the <code>counter-increment</code> property; <code>pages</code> then stores the value of the total number of pages in your document. Neither counter needs an initial <code>counter-reset</code> definition [TKTK CHECK THIS], however you can reset the <code>page</code> counter at any time, which will restart the page numbering at 1 (or whatever value you specify). This is useful for documents that have a preface or other introductory content, where you'd want to restart the page numbering at 1 with the first real chapter.</p>

<p>You reset the <code>page</code> counter just as you would any other:</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
section.chapter {
&nbsp; counter-reset: page;
}
</pre>

<p>text</p>
</section>

<p>Once you have a counter created, you can dynamically insert the current counter value by referencing it in the <code>content</code> property of an HTML element, like this: <code>content: counter(<em>countername</em>);</code>. This will insert whatever the value of the counter is at the moment that the element appears; for example, if you're inserting the page counter, then the current page number will appear. If you're inserting the chapternumber counter that we created above, then the actual content that appears will be the number of the current chapter.</p>

<p>For example, say you want to insert the current chapter number before every chapter title. You know that chapter titles are always tagged as <code>h1</code> elements and are the only <code>h1</code> elements that will be direct children of the parent <code>section</code> element. You can then use the <code>:before</code> pseudo class on those <code>h1</code> elements to add the chapter number counter that we created previously, along with a text string (&quot;: &quot;) to make things look nice.</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
section.chapter &gt; h1:before {
&nbsp; content: counter(chapternumber) &quot;: &quot;;
}
</pre>

<p>INSERT FIGURE: rendered result, before and after</p>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Strings</h1>

<p>Strings are not new to CSS, but they have a lot of power within the context of printed media. A string is like a saved variable that can be used in different places throughout a document. For example, you could save your headings as a string, and then print those titles as a running header across every page of your document. As the headings change, so too does the running header.&nbsp;</p>
