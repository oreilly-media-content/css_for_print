<h1>Responsive Books</h1>

<p>A book used to be a simple concept: content printed on a stack of paper, bound together. Today, publishers need to create books in multiple formats for many different platforms: an iPad, a Kindle, the Web, and of course our trusty printed stack of paper. It's unreasonable to expect publishers to completely re-format their content for each output. That would be expensive, and what would they do if a new format was suddenly developed? They'd have to go through the whole process all over again.</p>

<p>The separation of content and design is a crucial part of the modern book publishing process. Just like websites, book content these days needs to be responsive. It needs to be able to reflow and reshape itself to whatever the output may be--including print! Publishers need to be able to cope with the evolving world of digital publishing: &quot;Create Once, Publish Everywhere.&quot;</p>

<h1>Markup: A Digression</h1>

<p>Responsive content depends on good, clean, consistent markup. Don't add extra stuff to your markup to make it work for one format or the other. Do all of that stuff in the CSS targeted at each format. For example, don't use forced breaks (<code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>), but instead set widths and margins on elements.</p>

<p>What is ok to add: Classes or other attributes, wrappers that don't impose formatting (<code>span</code>, <code>div</code>, and so on).</p>
