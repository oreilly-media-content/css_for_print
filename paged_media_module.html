<h1>CSS3 Paged Media</h1>

<p>The paged media module was introduced along with CSS3, and takes print formatting with CSS to the next level. The paged media module redefines the CSS box model to apply specifically to the printed page, and gives designers control over things like page size, header and footer content, and more.</p>

<h1>@page</h1>

<p>The crux of paged media is the <code>@page</code> rule. <code>@page</code> allows you to define layout at the page level. When the content is rendered into pages, the properties you define with the <code>@page</code> rule will apply to every page (or subset of pages, as defined by you) of your document.</p>
