<h1>CSS3 Paged Media</h1>

<p>The paged media module was introduced along with CSS3, and takes print formatting with CSS to the next level. It's exactly what it sounds like: new properties a rules targeted specifically at content that is going to be rendered into distinct pages. The paged media module redefines the CSS box model to apply specifically to the printed page, and gives designers control over things like page size, header and footer content, and more.</p>

When the content is rendered into pages, the properties you define with the <code>@page</code> rule will apply to every page (or subset of pages, as defined by you) of your document.</p>
