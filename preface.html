<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>In the fall of 2011, my boss at O'Reilly presented me with an irresistible challenge: could we format our printed books using CSS? O'Reilly had long had a markup-centric book workflow, using XML to tag the book content, and XSL-FO to format it along with a PDF processing program called Antenna House. But XSL-FO is an intricate language and finding people to write our stylesheets was becoming increasingly harder, so when Antenna House announced that they were rolling out support for CSS formatting based on the CSS3 Paged Media specification, we saw a chance to simplify and modernize.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, about 80% of O'Reilly's books go through an HTML- and CSS-based production toolchain.</p>

<p>This book is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to HTML and CSS; rather, it will focus only on the aspects of those languages specific to printing and paged media. In fact, this book will assume that you already have a decent grasp of the basics of both HTML and CSS (though I'll do my best to point you to background information as we go). There are many resources available for you to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>

<h1>A Note About the Code</h1>

<p>I'll use the HTMLBook markup spec for most of &nbsp;my code samples. It's a sort of microformat created and adopted by O'Reilly to markup book content. (<span data-type="footnote">Disclaimer: yes, I was part of the team that developed the spec, so obviously I think it is awesome.)&nbsp;</span></p>
