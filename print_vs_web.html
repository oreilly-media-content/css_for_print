<h1>Print vs. Web</h1>

<p>In this chapter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Paper has a set size
	<ul>
		<li>Home printers generally use the same size paper</li>
		<li>Commercial printing sizes vary</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Links
	<ul>
		<li>use generated content to show the url? Also a different font style, to show readers that this was a link (otherwise some sentences may not make any sense, with the loss of link-context)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Units of measure</li>
	<li>Color</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing CSS almost always entails an element of design. Even if you're interpreting a comp from a designer into CSS, you're going to run into situations where a design &nbsp;judgement call needs to be made.</p>

<p>Translating web design to print: literal translation doesn't always make sense.</p>

<p>Responsive design: styling for print can be thought of as another piece of responsive design. Create once, print everywhere.</p>

<h1>Units of Measure</h1>

<p>We're used to pixels and ems in the web world, but these are equally inappropriate for the print world. What is a pixel on a piece of paper? Because we're dealing with fixed measures, it's appropriate to use a unit that corresponds to that measure. Inches (in) and points (pt) are both great (you could also use percentages, though results will vary depending on how and where you use it).</p>

<h1>Page Size</h1>

<p>Also, bear in mind that most home printers impose a mandatory un-printable margin on every page. This is space that the printer needs to pull the paper through the machinery, and can't be printed on. Commercial printers generally trim pages, to allow for full bleeds. When including bleeds in a design, keep in mind who will be printing and what kind of equipment they have. Try to make your design work for as many people as possible (unless you are making an artistic statement, and then by all means follow your heart. Art is not dead.)</p>

<h5>Respect Your Users' Ink</h5>

<p>When you start a design project, you need to know the constraints: who's the audience, what media will the project appear in, what's the budget? When you're building a print stylesheet for a web page, you don't really know what those constraints are. Sure, you could target the stylesheet at high-end multi-color inkjet printers that can handle a variety of paper sizes, but most of your home audience is probably working with something a lot simpler, like a black-and-white 8.5 x 11 printer, and they're probably <em>not</em> printing your web page to frame and hang on the wall. Think about why someone might want to print the information on your web page, and optimize the print design for that purpose and for your users' printers.</p>

<p>It's another way of thinking about responsive design: responsive for the home-printer. This doesn't mean that you need to eliminate all color from the print CSS, but make sure that whatever color you use is going to look ok in gray as well. And most importantly, don't waste your users' ink. For example, white text on an all-black page is probably not the best choice.</p>
