<h1>Print vs. Web</h1>

<p>In this chapter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Paper has a set size
	<ul>
		<li>Home printers generally use the same size paper</li>
		<li>Commercial printing sizes vary</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Links
	<ul>
		<li>use generated content to show the url? Also a different font style, to show readers that this was a link (otherwise some sentences may not make any sense, with the loss of link-context)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Units</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing CSS almost always entails an element of design. Even if you're interpreting a comp from a designer into CSS, you're going to run into situations where a design &nbsp;judgement call needs to be made.</p>

<p>Translating web design to print: literal translation doesn't always make sense.</p>

<p>Also, bear in mind that most home printers impose a mandatory un-printable margin on every page. This is space that the printer needs to pull the paper through the machinery, and can't be printed on. Commercial printers generally trim pages, to allow for full bleeds. When including bleeds in a design, keep in mind who will be printing and what kind of equipment they have. Try to make your design work for as many people as possible (unless you are making an artistic statement, and then by all means follow your heart. Art is not dead.)</p>

<p>Responsive design: styling for print can be thought of as another piece of responsive design. Create once, print everywhere.</p>

<h1>Units of Measure</h1>

<p>We're used to pixels and ems in the web world, but these are equally inappropriate for the print world. What is a pixel on a piece of paper? Because we're dealing with fixed measures, it's appropriate to use a unit that corresponds to that measure. Inches (in) and points (pt) are both great (you could also use percentages, though results will vary depending on how and where you use it).</p>
