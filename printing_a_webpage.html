<h1>Printing a Webpage</h1>

<p>Alright, so we have a webpage. Let's use my website version of this book as the example. We need to strip some stuff out that doesn't make sense for print. Then we'll get really fancy and make it look bookish. In my webpage, I'll use a grid, floats, have a sidebar with links pointing to external sites, ad for my book, and header banner.</p>

<p>There are a few of ways to specify distinct styles for web or print media. You can link separate stylesheets in the head of your document, and use the media attribute to specify which stylesheet should be used for print, and which is for the web.</p>

<pre data-code-language="html" data-original-title="" title="">
&lt;LINK rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;screen.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
&lt;LINK rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;print.css&quot; media=&quot;print&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>You could also use media queries within a single stylesheet, with separate sections for print and web. The nice thing about media queries is that you can use overrides to only alter specific styles, while maintaining some universal styles for all media, all within a single file.</p>

<pre data-code-language="css" data-original-title="" title="">
@media print {
  selector {
&nbsp;   styles;
&nbsp; }
}

@media screen {
  selector {
    styles;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>You can choose whichever method you're most comfortable with; however, for the examples in this book, we'll assume you're using media queries.</p>
