<h1>Printing a Webpage</h1>

<p>Print has a user experience that's been honed over hundreds of years, so it shouldn't come as a shock to us that some people still prefer to look at information on a printed page.&nbsp;If you've got content that you suspect some user at some point might want to print (a travel itinerary, short novel, CV, etc.), you'll want to make sure you style for that. Along with all your careful responsive CSS styling, you can take things to the next level with a custom print stylesheet as well.</p>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Adding CSS Styles for Print</h1>

<p>There are a few of ways to specify distinct styles for web or print media. You can link separate stylesheets in the head of your document, and use the media attribute to specify which stylesheet should be used for print, and which is for the web.</p>

<pre data-code-language="html" data-original-title="" title="">
&lt;LINK rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;screen.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
&lt;LINK rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;print.css&quot; media=&quot;print&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>You could also use media queries within a single stylesheet, with separate sections for print and web. The nice thing about media queries is that you can use overrides to alter only specific styles, while maintaining some universal styles for all media, all within a single file.</p>

<pre data-code-language="css" data-original-title="" title="">
h1 {
&nbsp; font-family: sans-serif;
}

@media print {
  h1 {
&nbsp;   font-size: 24pt;
    color: #000;
&nbsp; }
}

@media screen {
  h1 {
    background-color: #000;
&nbsp;   color: #fff;
&nbsp;   font-size: 3em;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>You can choose whichever method you're most comfortable with; however, for the examples in this book, we'll be using media queries.</p>

<div data-type="warning">
<h1>Warning</h1>

<p>As always, you need to keep browser support in mind when using print media queries. <code>@media print</code> isn't supported by Internet Explorer 8 and earlier, so if you know people will be trying to print your site using that browser, then you'll want to use a separate print stylesheet using the <code>link</code> method above. <code>@media print</code> is supported by the following: FireFox 3.5, Internet Explorer 9, Chrome 14, Safari 3.2, and Opera 11.</p>
</div>

<div data-type="note">
<h1>Note</h1>

<p>All the usual cascading and specificity rules apply when you're using media queries or separate stylesheets. This means that if you've defined a style using a certain level of specificity, in order to override that style in your print styles, you need to use the same selectors that you previously used. For example, to override this style: <code>h1.title {color: red;}</code>, you must use the same h1.title selector; just using <code>h1</code> or<code> .title</code>&nbsp;on their own won't cut it.</p>

<h1>Page Layout</h1>

<p>The first potential issue when re-working CSS for print is the basic page layout. If your website is just a plain linear flow of text, then this won't be a big problem for you. But unfortunately, web designers these days are pretty darn good at making complex, beautiful layouts for the Web, using things like absolute or fixed positioning, floats and grids, banners, and so on, to create a responsive website that looks great on any digital device. Our task is to figure out how to translate that design for print as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first step in writing the print CSS is to look at the content and think about the best way it would look as a printed page. Ask yourself some questions about the content, for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is there a banner of some kind at the top of the web page? Will that banner work in print? Is there a way to make it look better, or optimize it for a printed page?</li>
	<li>Is there a navigation menu? Does the navigation menu need to be as easily seen as it does on the web page? What is the purpose of the navigation menu? Is the navigation menu even necessary on the printed page?</li>
	<li>Does the main content have inconsistent margins, or elements that float out into the page margin? Is it possible/practical to preserve this effect in print, or should all the content flow in a single block with a set margin?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that you can't expect your audience to all have the exact same printer, as well. Think about how printer margins, paper sizes, inks, and so on, might vary amongst your users, and be sure to answer these questions in light of those differences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also need to consider the flow of the actual source HTML, and the framework behind the page. In most cases, you don't want to rework the content markup for the print output--instead, you want to write CSS on top of that markup. For example, in the source flow, if the navigation menu is located before the main content, you don't want to cut-and-paste the code block for that nav menu to move it to a different spot; instead, you need to find a way to negotiate both leaving the source alone and getting it to look good in print.</p>

<p>Many frameworks and websites these days use the concept of a <em>grid</em> to set up the page. The grid is a well-established tool in the field of graphic design, with a slight twist when it comes to CSS. A grid in web design generally consists of a fixed number of blocks the stretch the allowed content area. Sometimes the content area is the entire screen width (however much that may be, since screens come in all shapes and sizes), and sometimes the content area is set to a fixed width that changes based on common screen sizes (for example, the allowed content area may be 900px for a PC, and then switch to 100% width for a smartphone). Additionally, the grid divisions may be set to fixed sizes (for example, each grid column is 60px with a 20px margin), or may be set to a percentage of the content area (each grid column is 10% of the content area, again with a 20px margin).</p>

<p>If your web page uses a reflowable grid based on floats, then you may be able to leverage that CSS when optimizing for print. Try printing the page out too see if you need to completely rework the layout, of if you can start with the existing grid. We'll dive deeper into some tactics to use for specific CSS properties in the following sections.</p>

<h1>Page Size</h1>

<p>Page size is a fundamental aspect of printed media, and fortunately something most web designers are already accustomed to thinking about in the context of mobile and responsive design. When your viewing a web page in a browser window on a PC, you can usually resize the window as it suits you, and the content reflows to fit your new dimensions; however, the browser window on a smartphone is typically a fixed size that you can't control. Designing for print is more like the latter case--you've got a fixed dimension for your content, however that fixed dimension might change between two devices. Just as the browser window size on, say, an Android phone might be different from that of an iPhone, so too might the paper size of one printer be different from another. For example, your European readers might be using A4 paper, whereas your US audience is printing to standard letter size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, in the majority of cases, there's likely much less variation in page size for printed output than in digital devices, though it's best not to make any assumptions. If you've already got responsive media queries in place for different page sizes, build on top of those for your print CSS as well, letting the content reflow based on page size, and then optimizing further for print output.</p>

<p>Also, bear in mind that most home printers impose a mandatory un-printable margin on every page. This is space that the printer needs to pull the paper through the machinery, and can't be printed on. Commercial printers generally trim pages, to allow for full bleeds (a <em>bleed</em> is any printed area that runs all the way to the edge of the page). When including bleeds in a design, keep in mind who will be printing and what kind of equipment they have. Try to make your design work for as many people as possible (unless you are making an artistic statement, and then by all means follow your heart).</p>

<p>The user's system may also impost some print elements on your pages--for example, a mandatory url in the margin area pointing back to your site.</p>

<h1>Units of Measure</h1>

<p>We're used to pixels and ems in the web world, but these are equally inappropriate for the print world. What is a pixel on a piece of paper? Because we're dealing with fixed measures, it's appropriate to use a unit that corresponds to that measure. Inches (in) and points (pt) are both great (you could also use percentages, though results will vary depending on how and where you use it).</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Color</h1>

<p>Print uses a different color space: CMYK.</p>

<p>Use percentages for each ink color, from 0% to 100%, or a decimal value from 0 to 1.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar">
<h5>Respect Your Users' Ink</h5>

<p>When you start a design project, you need to know the constraints: who's the audience, what media will the project appear in, what's the budget? When you're building a print stylesheet for a web page, you don't really know what those constraints are. Sure, you could target the stylesheet at high-end multi-color inkjet printers that can handle a variety of paper sizes, but most of your home audience is probably working with something a lot simpler, like a black-and-white 8.5 x 11 printer, and they're probably <em>not</em> printing your web page to frame and hang on the wall. Think about why someone might want to print the information on your web page, and optimize the print design for that purpose and for your users' printers.</p>

<p>It's another way of thinking about responsive design: responsive for the home-printer. This doesn't mean that you need to eliminate all color from the print CSS, but make sure that whatever color you use is going to look ok in gray as well. And most importantly, don't waste your users' ink. For example, white text on an all-black page is probably not the best choice.</p>
