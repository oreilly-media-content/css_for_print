<h1>Printing a Webpage</h1>

<p>Alright, so we have a webpage. Let's use my website version of this book as the example. We need to strip some stuff out that doesn't make sense for print. Then we'll get really fancy and make it look bookish. In my webpage, I'll use a grid, floats, have a sidebar with links pointing to external sites, ad for my book, and header banner.</p>

<p>There are a few of ways to specify distinct styles for web or print media. You can link separate stylesheets in the head of your document, and use the media attribute to specify which stylesheet should be used for print, and which is for the web.</p>

<pre data-code-language="html" data-original-title="" title="">
&lt;LINK rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;screen.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
&lt;LINK rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;print.css&quot; media=&quot;print&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>You could also use media queries within a single stylesheet, with separate sections for print and web. The nice thing about media queries is that you can use overrides to alter only specific styles, while maintaining some universal styles for all media, all within a single file.</p>

<pre data-code-language="css" data-original-title="" title="">
h1 {
&nbsp; font-family: sans-serif;
}

@media print {
  h1 {
&nbsp;   font-size: 24pt;
    color: #000;
&nbsp; }
}

@media screen {
  h1 {
    background-color: #000;
&nbsp;   color: #fff;
&nbsp;   font-size: 3em;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>You can choose whichever method you're most comfortable with; however, for the examples in this book, we'll assume you're using media queries.</p>

<h1>Page Layout</h1>

<p>The first potential issue when re-working CSS for print is the basic page layout. If your website is just a plain linear flow of text, then this won't be a big problem for you. But unfortunately, web designers these days are pretty darn good at making complex, beautiful layouts for the Web, using things like absolute or fixed positioning, floats and grids, banners, and so on, to create a responsive website that looks great on any digital device. Our task is to figure out how to translate that design for print as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many frameworks and websites these days use the concept of a <em>grid</em> to set up the page. The grid is an established tool in the field of graphic design, with a slight twist when it comes to CSS. A grid in web design generally consists of a fixed number of blocks the stretch the allowed content area. Sometimes the content area is the entire screen width (however much that may be, since screens come in all shapes and sizes), and sometimes the content area is set to a fixed width that changes based on common screen sizes (for example, the allowed content area may be 900px for a PC, and then switch to 100% width for a smartphone). Additionally, the grid divisions may be set to fixed sizes (for example, each grid column is 60px with a 20px margin), or may be set to a percentage of the content area (each grid column is 10% of the content area, again with a 20px margin).</p>

<p>The first step in writing the print CSS is to look at the content and think about the best way it would look as a printed page. Is there a banner of some kind at the top of the web page? Will that banner work in print? Is there a way to make it look better, or optimize it for a printed page? Is there a navigation menu? Does the navigation menu need to be as easily seen as it does on the web page? What is the purpose of the navigation menu? Is the navigation menu even necessary on the printed page?</p>
