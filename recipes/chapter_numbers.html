<h1>Add Chapter Numbers Using Counters</h1>

<p>The chapter is generally the primary chunking level for most books, and chapter numbers are applied to mark the sequence of the document. Let's create a counter to add chapter numbering to a book, and then print that chapter number before each chapter heading.</p>

<h1>Creating the Counter</h1>

<p>In order to create our counter, we need to know how our chapters are tagged. As always, it's important to use consistent and clear semantics in the HTML, so that you can write targeted and scalable CSS. In our document, we use a section tag to wrap our chapters, and since we use sections in other places as well, we've added a custom data-type attribute of &quot;chapter&quot; to those sections so there's no confusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>section[data-type=&quot;chapter&quot;]</p>
