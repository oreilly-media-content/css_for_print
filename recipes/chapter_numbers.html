<h1>Add Chapter Numbers Using Counters</h1>

<p>The chapter is generally the primary chunking level for most books, and chapter numbers are applied to mark the sequence of the document. Let's create a counter to add chapter numbering to a book, and then print that chapter number before each chapter heading.</p>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Creating the Counter</h1>

<p>In order to create our counter, we need to know how our chapters are tagged. As always, it's important to use consistent and clear semantics in the HTML, so that you can write targeted and scalable CSS. In our document, we use a <code>section</code> tag to wrap our chapters, and since we use the <code>section</code> tag in other places as well, we've added a custom <code>data-type</code> attribute of &quot;chapter&quot; to those sections so there's no confusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now we apply the <code>counter-increment</code> property to every occurrence of our chapter-level sections. We'll create a counter with the name &quot;chapternumber&quot;, because clarity is for winners.</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
section[data-type=&quot;chapter&quot;] {
&nbsp; counter-increment: chapternumber;
}
</pre>

<p>Now every occurrence of a section with a <code>data-type</code> of &quot;chapter&quot; will increment the chapternumber counter by one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, before the counter can start incrementing, we need to initiate it by using the <code>counter-reset</code> property somewhere at the beginning of our document. Let's apply it to the main parent element:</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
body {
&nbsp; counter-reset: chapternumber;
}
</pre>

<p>As we learned from TK, <code>counter-reset</code> both acts as an initiator for a counter, and resets the counter as needed. By initiating our counter at the very beginning of the document, we're ensuring that the first occurrence of <code>section[data-type=&quot;chapter&quot;]</code> will start off at number one.</p>

<p>That's all we need to get the counter going. Now let's print it at the beginning of every chapter heading. We'll identify the heading elements, then use the <code>:before</code>&nbsp;pseudoclass to add the chapter number, and then just for kicks we'll split the chapter number and chapter title across two lines.</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
section[data-type=&quot;chapter&quot;] &gt; h1:before {
&nbsp; content: &quot;Chapter &quot; counter(chapternumber);
&nbsp; display: block;
&nbsp; margin-bottom: 0.12in;
}
</pre>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Code Breakdown</h2>

<p>All our chapter headings are tagged as h1 level headings, and are direct children of the parent section. Additionally, we know that we won't have any other h1 direct children, so this is all we need to target the chapter headings.</p>

<p>To print the counter, we use the content property. We want to add the text &quot;Chapter &quot; before the actual number; you can combine types of content within the content property, making sure to place text strings in quotes.</p>

<p>In order to display the chapter number on it's own line (as opposed to inline with the chapter heading), we give the display property a value of block. This means that we want to treat this element as a block element, instead of an inline.</p>

<p>Add a little space below the chapter number, to make things look nice.</p>
