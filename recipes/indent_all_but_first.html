<h1>Indent All Paragraphs Except After Headings</h1>

<p>A standard design practice is to indent all plain text paragraphs except for those that immediately follow a heading. We can use pseudoclasses to achieve this.</p>

<p>p {</p>

<p>&nbsp; text-indent: 20pt;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>h1 &gt; p:first-of-type {</p>

<p>&nbsp; text-indent: 0;</p>

<p>}</p>
